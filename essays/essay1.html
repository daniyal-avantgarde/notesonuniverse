    <h1>The Fall of Rome</h1>
    <p>The fall of Rome is a complex historical event that took place over several centuries, culminating in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. Various factors contributed to this decline, including economic troubles, military defeats, and internal strife.</p>
    <p>One of the key factors was the empire's overreliance on slave labor, which stifled innovation and economic growth. Additionally, the empire faced increasing pressure from barbarian invasions, particularly from groups like the Visigoths and Vandals.</p>
    <p>Political instability also played a significant role, with a series of weak and ineffective emperors leading to corruption and civil wars. The division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves further weakened its ability to respond to external threats.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the fall of Rome marked the end of ancient civilization and the beginning of the Middle Ages in Europe. It serves as a reminder of the fragility of empires and the importance of adaptability in the face of change.</p>
